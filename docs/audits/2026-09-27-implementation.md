# Implementation audit — 27 September 2026

[Handbook](../handbook/README.md) · [OpenRouter](2026-09-27-openrouter.md) · [UI](2026-09-27-ui.md) · [Verification](2026-09-27-verification.md) · [Philosophy](../working-philosophy.md)

## Scope and conclusion

Initial review covered the working tree on top of `011641f`; see the dated OpenRouter follow-up below for the subsequent compatibility repairs.

**The workspace and authoring foundation are substantial. The media-provider contracts have improved, but the full guided workflow is not release-ready.** OpenRouter media routing has mocked coverage; a live OpenRouter-only workflow has not been run. Current verification found **593 passing backend tests and 23 failures**, all in the known AtlasCloud migration/settings contract set. Frontend check passes; no paid model call or graphical walkthrough was performed.

“Implemented” below means code and relevant entry points exist. It does not mean all models, operating systems, or end-to-end cases were verified.

## Highest-priority findings

### Follow-up — OpenRouter compatibility repair (27 September 2026)

The OpenRouter fixes covered by [the compatibility follow-up](2026-09-27-openrouter.md) resolve the earlier F01, F02, F03, and F05 code-path findings: video downloads now use the authenticated content endpoint; media services resolve the configured provider; settings pair provider and model defaults; and video references/frame anchors and capabilities use the documented API contract. F09's OpenRouter image response handling and expiry state are also covered. Local image data-URL references in the video endpoint, account-specific model behavior, and a full zero-AtlasCloud workflow remain live verification gates. The 23 failing tests match the original baseline failure set and do not include the new OpenRouter regression tests.

### F01 — OpenRouter video output cannot follow the documented download flow (P1, resolved in follow-up)

**Evidence:** `process_job` in [poll_service.py](../../app/services/poll_service.py) passes the provider URL to `media.download`. [media.py](../../app/services/media.py) makes an unauthenticated GET. OpenRouter's content URLs require its API credential; details and primary source are in the compatibility report.

**Impact:** generation can succeed remotely and be billed, then fail to produce a local output. Resubmitting may pay for another video.

**Acceptance:** authenticated download through the correct provider client; credential forwarding restricted to the intended origin; redirect handling tested; fallback content retrieval when appropriate; recovery downloads the existing job without regenerating it.

### F02 — OpenRouter-only creation still invokes AtlasCloud (P1, routing resolved; live workflow unverified)

**Evidence:** `start_render` and `generate_storyboard_for_scene` create `AtlasCloudUploadResolver`; character sheets and `generate_scene_assets` instantiate `AtlasCloudImageProvider` directly.

**Reproduction:** configure only OpenRouter, create a scene requiring generated props or local references, then execute that path. The selected OpenRouter media provider does not eliminate AtlasCloud calls.

**Acceptance:** use provider-aware reference transport and one image-provider resolution path for characters, props, and storyboards; a mocked full workflow must make zero AtlasCloud calls in OpenRouter-only mode.

### F03 — Provider/model settings disagree across paths (P1, resolved in follow-up)

**Evidence:** `APP_SETTING_DEFAULTS['video_model']` maps to `atlas_video_model`. `resolve` uses configuration before its `default` argument. A local reproduction with `DEFAULT_VIDEO_PROVIDER=openrouter` returned `minimax/h3-developer/text-to-video`. The OpenRouter image adapter reads `openrouter_image_model` directly, ignoring the UI's `image_model` setting. Shot rendering also does not apply the same provider selection logic as whole-scene rendering.

**Acceptance:** resolve provider plus model as one typed configuration for all generation paths; test fresh environment-only setup, UI overrides, project overrides, and retries. Invalid combinations fail before submission.

### F04 — AtlasCloud migration dropped visual contracts (P1, adapter path resolved; live provider check outstanding)

**Initial audit evidence:** [AtlasCloud video adapter](../../app/providers/atlascloud_video.py) had replaced earlier provider payload assumptions, and the initial suite contained stale assertions for those payloads. The follow-up now routes the default to H3 Developer Reference-to-Video, passes stored references in `refers`, flattens ordered shot dialogue into one prompt, requests audible dialogue, and validates resolutions according to the selected H3 model. The older H3 reference model ID remains supported with its own resolution set.

**Impact:** stored character sheets, storyboards, and frame anchors can look active in the UI while having no image influence on H3. Legacy model IDs can receive H3-shaped payloads.

**Acceptance:** model-specific capabilities, truthful UI, migration behavior, and contract tests are implemented. Live account credentials, provider-side acceptance, generated speech quality, and video retrieval remain unverified.

### F05 — OpenRouter reference semantics and limits are guessed (P1, request contract resolved; live inputs unverified)

**Evidence:** [video adapter](../../app/providers/openrouter_video.py) maps the first two ordinary image references to first/last frames. [capabilities](../../app/providers/capabilities.py) assumes up to two references, generic aspect ratios, and duration ranges based on substrings in the model ID. See the provider report for the API distinction.

**Acceptance:** distinct style/content references and frame anchors; model-derived supported durations/resolutions/aspect ratios/reference modes; validate before uploads and submission. Test unsupported audio/video references explicitly.

### F06 — Project switches can redirect background context (P1, code-path risk)

**Evidence:** the server has one active project; `start_op` starts a new session without pinning a project ID, and generation services repeatedly call `active_project_id`. The layout caches the project name only once.

**Impact:** switching projects while a long operation runs can associate later artifacts or configuration with another project. This has not been reproduced through concurrent browser sessions.

**Acceptance:** operation and every generated artifact are bound to the originating project; switching during mocked delayed generation must not change ownership. Refresh the displayed active project after navigation.

### F07 — Guided controls overstate behavior (P2)

**Evidence:** [video_generation_service.py](../../app/services/video_generation_service.py) implements only the `dialogue` branch; `narration` and `off` skip conversion. Existing style wins over selected style. Language/instruction do not consistently reach all stages. Stages are returned only after submission finishes, while the UI displays a progressing checklist.

**Acceptance:** implement or remove unsupported choices; show effective style/language; persist stage updates; distinguish job submission from completed videos; preserve operation tracking across refresh. See the [UI report](2026-09-27-ui.md).

### F08 — Forward shot dependencies raise KeyError (P2, reproduced)

**Evidence:** [visual_dependency_service.py](../../app/services/visual_dependency_service.py) checks parents against all IDs but looks up only previously calculated layers. Calling `build_shot_dependencies([{'id':'a','depends_on':['b']},{'id':'b'}])` raises `KeyError: 'b'`.

**Acceptance:** validate/topologically order dependencies or explicitly reject forward edges with an actionable error; cover cycles, duplicates, missing parents, and disconnected shots. Rendering must consume this metadata before it can be described as dependency-controlled generation.

### F09 — Media representation and lifecycle assumptions are incomplete (P2, OpenRouter response handling resolved; general client lifecycle remains)

**Evidence:** OpenRouter image polling consumes only the first result, assumes PNG, and removes the response from its process-local cache. AtlasCloud text-to-image requests JPEG while services name downloads `.png`. HTTP clients are created without a consistent close lifecycle. OpenRouter `expired` normalizes to pending (reproduced).

**Acceptance:** persist the intended output(s), preserve media type/extension, define image job lifecycle, close clients, and map every terminal provider status. Cover malformed/error payloads and transport timeouts.

### F10 — Storage configuration can break previews (P2, code evidence)

**Evidence:** [frontend API helper](../../frontend/src/lib/api.ts) builds media URLs by searching for literal `storage/` in a stored path. A valid alternate storage root without that substring returns no URL.

**Acceptance:** backend supplies storage-relative public URLs independent of filesystem naming; cover default, custom absolute, and Windows-style paths.

## Repair sequence and completion gates

| Order | Work | Completion gate |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | F01–F05 provider contracts and routing | A selected route stays on that route, receives supported inputs, and retrieves outputs; regression tests pass |
| 2 | F06 project ownership and F08 dependencies | Switching/restarting cannot misattribute work; dependency errors are actionable |
| 3 | F07 guided flow and setup readiness | Empty-project journey tells the truth about prerequisites, progress, cost-bearing actions, and completion |
| 4 | F09–F10 lifecycle/media handling | Terminal states, files, clients, and previews behave consistently |
| 5 | UI simplification and recovery | Capability-filtered controls, persisted tracking, clear retry/download actions, responsive inspection |
| 6 | Remote retrieval, best-of-k, assembly | Add these only with a connected workflow and measurable acceptance criteria |

The guided flow does not explicitly create character records or reference sheets from a newly invented cast. Empty-project generation can therefore proceed with names in prompts but without durable character identities. Add a cast-review/creation stage if automatic persistent characters are part of the intended first-video promise. Automatic asset-generation errors are also logged and swallowed by `create_shots`, so users can receive shots without the expected props; expose that as a recoverable warning.

The 23 backend failures from the initial audit have been addressed; the current local suite reports **640 passed**. The changed assertions now match the provider-specific payloads, with route behavior covered by regression tests. A release gate still needs a fresh-install run, a browser walkthrough, and a scoped paid provider smoke test. This audit branch is not a release approval.
