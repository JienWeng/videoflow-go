# VideoFlow handbook

This handbook describes the local VideoFlow workflow inspected on 27 September 2026. Start here whether you have an empty computer, an empty VideoFlow project, or an existing story.

**Current readiness:** Go backend and SvelteKit frontend tests pass, and zero-dependency single binary build is operational. Confirm credentials, account access, and model behavior before production use. AtlasCloud and OpenRouter routes are supported. See [provider setup](03-providers.md).

## Read in order

## Choose a starting point

- **Nothing installed:** begin with Part 2. You do not need an existing code project, database, video, character, or GPU to open the app.
- **App running, empty project:** configure Part 3, create a project in Part 4, and follow Part 5.
- **Need controlled production:** follow Parts 6–10, reviewing each stage before the next paid request.

Examples describe expected behavior, not a promise that every external model succeeds. Provider access, selected models, account credit, and the limitations recorded in the audit still apply.
