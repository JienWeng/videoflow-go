# 8. Studio and guided chat

[Handbook](README.md) · Previous: [Scenes and shots](07-scenes-shots.md) · Next: [Renders](09-renders.md)

Studio is the advanced relationship view at `/`. It shows characters, assets, scenes, shots, render jobs, and outputs as connected entities.

## Inspect and edit relationships

1. Open **Advanced → Studio**.
2. Select a node to inspect or edit its details.
3. Connect a character to a scene to add it to the cast.
4. Connect an asset to a shot to attach a reference.
5. Remove an edge to detach that relationship; this is different from deleting the underlying entity.
6. Reorder shots using the available shot controls/canvas interaction and confirm the resulting order in Scenes.

Use the graph to answer “Which asset belongs to this shot?” or “Which output came from this scene?” For a first story, Create video or Scenes offers a more direct path.

## Guided chat

Type a concrete request, such as “Generate a storyboard for the kitchen scene.” Chat classifies the intent and prepares an action card. Review the selected entity and fields, then use **Run** to call the pipeline action.

The docked chat panel on the right can be collapsed to make room for the canvas, restored from its edge control, or expanded to give the conversation more width. Drag the divider to adjust the split when both panes are open.

A chat response alone does not mean a video was generated. The application executes the reviewed action through an endpoint. Requests for generation, refinement, or recognition may consume provider usage.

Press **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+K** (macOS) to open the global command palette. Studio-specific node focus actions need the Studio canvas; navigation commands can be used from other pages.

**Expected result:** the intended relationship or action appears in the stored workspace. If an action fails, inspect its error and existing artifacts before repeating it. Browser interaction details still need visual verification; this handbook is grounded in the current UI source.
