## Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Provider | External service hosting a model |

| Agent | A specific planning or review role with a schema-validated response |
| Engine | Image/video/vision model configuration exposed in Settings |
| Character bible | Stored appearance, personality, visual rules, and voice rules |
| Asset | Uploaded or generated file with metadata |
| Storyboard / 分镜图 | Contact sheet showing planned scene beats |
| RenderSpec | Structured request passed from application logic to a video adapter |
| Operation | Background planning/image/caption task tracked through `/ops` |
| Render job | Provider generation attempt, polled by the worker |

## Configuration map

| Variable | Role |
|---|---|
| `OPENCODE_GO_API_KEY` | Current default text-agent connection credential |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Built-in OpenRouter credential; fixed endpoint https://openrouter.ai/api/v1 |
| `OPENROUTER_TEXT_MODEL` | OpenRouter text model default |
| `OPENROUTER_IMAGE_MODEL`, `OPENROUTER_VIDEO_MODEL` | OpenRouter media defaults, used when no saved model override exists |
| `DEFAULT_IMAGE_PROVIDER`, `DEFAULT_VIDEO_PROVIDER` | Initial media defaults; saved settings may override them, so confirm the effective route in the Create preflight panel |
| `DATABASE_URL`, `STORAGE_ROOT` | Local database and media locations |
| `POLL_INTERVAL_S`, `POLL_TIMEOUT_S` | Render polling timing |
| `LLM_TIMEOUT_S`, `LLM_MAX_RETRIES` | Text request timeout and validation retries |
| `OPENROUTER_VISION_MODEL` | Vision model default; timed transcription model is saved in Settings |
| `VITE_API_BASE` | Frontend API base override; configured for the frontend process/build |

[`.env.example`](../.env.example) lists the primary configuration. Saved database settings can override environment defaults.

## Navigation and API

| Screen | Route | Main API areas |
|---|---|---|
| Create video | `/create` | `/videos/generate`, `/ops` |
| My videos | `/render` | `/render-jobs`, `/outputs` |
| Studio | `/` | `/graph`, `/chat` |
| Projects | `/projects` | `/projects` |
| Characters | `/characters` | `/characters` |
| Assets and style | `/assets` | `/assets`, `/style` |
| Scenes | `/scenes` | `/scripts`, `/scenes`, `/shots` |
| Output editor | `/editor/{output-id}` | `/outputs/{id}/editor`, caption endpoints |
| Settings | `/settings` | `/settings/providers`, `/settings/agents`, `/settings/app` |

Use the running Go backend for request schemas. Posting generation endpoints can incur provider usage. Health and model listing are not substitutes for an end-to-end generation check.

## Maintainer checks

From the repository root:

```sh
go test ./...
make build
```

From `frontend`:

```sh
npm run check
npm run build
```
