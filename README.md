## Download and use

For a beginner, choose the Electron app from the [GitHub downloads](https://github.com/JienWeng/videoflow-go/releases): install the macOS DMG or the Ubuntu/Debian DEB for your processor, open **VideoFlow**, and add your OpenRouter key in Settings. The desktop app includes its backend, frontend, FFmpeg, FFprobe and caption fonts. No Go, Node, Python or FFmpeg installation is required. AI generation needs internet access and OpenRouter credits. See [desktop beginner instructions](docs/DESKTOP-QUICKSTART.txt).

macOS preview packages are unsigned and may require approval in the system security settings. Linux AppImage and tar.gz alternatives are available for distributions permitting Chromium user namespaces; AppImage can also need FUSE.

The earlier browser launcher remains available: extract its native ZIP and open **Start VideoFlow**. See [browser launcher instructions](docs/QUICKSTART.txt). Developers can run the separate web frontend and backend using `docker compose up --build -d`; see [desktop and web build instructions](docs/ELECTRON-AND-WEB.md).

To build a download, build the frontend, run `python3 scripts/build_media.py` on the target platform, then run `python3 scripts/package.py --target <platform-architecture>`. Media build tools are documented in the builder; users do not need them. A tagged release runs checks and publishes four macOS/Linux archives with checksums. Start a local combined server with `bin/videoflow-server --desktop --ui-dir frontend/build`; add `--no-browser` for a service. The server binds to localhost by default; `--host` explicitly sets another interface.

# VideoFlow Go

A streamlined, high-performance, single-binary AI video studio backend built in **Go (Golang)** with an interactive **SvelteKit** frontend.

Forked and optimized from [videoflow](https://github.com/JienWeng/videoflow) to deliver **30x lower memory consumption**, instant database access with SQLite WAL mode, and seamless zero-dependency deployment.

---

## Performance Highlights

* **Single 17 MB Executable**: Contains the entire REST API, SSE streaming broker, background worker pool, media runner, and SQLite database engine.
* **~12.9 MB Idle RAM**: Over 30x less memory than the Python/FastAPI runtime (~400MB–1.2GB).
* **Instant Cold Boot**: Starts in `< 50 ms`.
* **Zero Dependency Setup**: No Python, no UV, no virtualenvs, no C++ compilation required.

## Quick Start

### 1. Build and Run the Go Backend

```bash
make build
./bin/videoflow-server
```
The server will start listening on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 2. Run the SvelteKit Frontend

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev -- --host 127.0.0.1
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

---

## Cross-Compilation

To produce standalone executables for other operating systems:

```bash
# Build for all platforms (Linux amd64/arm64, macOS Apple Silicon/Intel, Windows)
make build-all
```

Outputs will be saved in `bin/`:
* `bin/videoflow-server-linux-amd64`
* `bin/videoflow-server-darwin-arm64` (macOS Apple Silicon)
* `bin/videoflow-server-darwin-amd64` (macOS Intel)
* `bin/videoflow-server-windows-amd64.exe` (Windows)

---

## Configuration

Set environment variables in `.env` or in your shell:

| Variable | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PORT` | `8000` | HTTP API listen port |
| `STORAGE_ROOT` | `storage` | Path to store generated videos and images |
| `DATABASE_PATH` | `db.sqlite` | SQLite database file |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `""` | OpenRouter key for all AI generation and analysis |
| `OPENROUTER_TEXT_MODEL` | `openai/gpt-4o-mini` | Default text agent model |
| `OPENROUTER_VISION_MODEL` | `qwen/qwen3-vl-30b-a3b-instruct` | Default vision model |
| `OPENROUTER_IMAGE_MODEL` | `openai/gpt-image-2` | Default image/reference model |
| `OPENROUTER_VIDEO_MODEL` | `google/veo-3.1-lite` | Default video model |

---

All AI work uses OpenRouter. Save the key in Settings or set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`; saved settings take effect without restarting. See [OpenRouter setup](handbook/03-providers.md) for model catalogs, paid checks, and FFmpeg requirements.

## Desktop app and web deployment

Electron packaging reuses the Go backend and Svelte interface, bundling the media tools for desktop users. Separate frontend/backend containers remain available for web deployment. See [Electron and web build instructions](docs/ELECTRON-AND-WEB.md). The Electron workflow builds macOS and Linux installers for Intel and ARM processors.
